# Neumorphic Calculator Mini Project
# This script performs basic arithmetic operations:
# addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

--> using shell scripting

#!/bin/bash – Tells the system to run the script with Bash.

echo – Prints text to terminal.

read -p – Prompts the user for input and stores it in a variable.

while true; do ... done – Infinite loop, keeps program running until explicitly broken.

case ... in ... esac – Cleaner way to handle multiple conditions instead of many if-elif-else.

bc – Command-line calculator for performing arithmetic. Bash alone cannot handle floating-point numbers well.
